During the team meeting, we discussed several important items. Sarah mentioned that we should probably update the user documentation to reflect the new API changes. John pointed out that the authentication system needs a security review before we can deploy. We also need to make sure the database backup process is working correctly. The team agreed that someone should look into the performance issues we've been seeing with the search functionality. Finally, we decided that the frontend needs better error handling for when the API is unavailable.
